                <p>42nd Street Moon is producing HOT MIKADO, which is based on THE MIKADO. Asian American theatre makers in the Bay Area did a great deal of work in protest of Lamplighters Music Theatre's production of THE MIKADO in 2016, which led to widespread change surrounding that show. This year a few actors shared their feelings of discomfort surrounding HOT MIKADO. We don't know the script of HOT MIKADO that well and aren't sure if it's as racist as its predecessor, but it seems questionable. </p>
                <p>If it is as racist as THE MIKADO, it shouldn't be produced. </p>

                <p>Silhouette Productions "Music Man" in Cleveland, Ohio </p>
                <p>9/28/2019</p>
                <br>
                <p>I played Alma Hicks in the musical "Music Man" for Silhouette Productions. I was one of three black people in a cast of about 50, and the only that was a "Pick-a-little" girl. The director asked to run something with the Pick-a-littles and an older man in the cast said "you mean pickaninis?" And walked away laughing, pretending not to hear me ask him not to say that. I emailed the director, music director, and producer about the incident. The director, a younger white man, was very apologetic, admitted he heard it in rehearsal before but didn't know what it meant, and wanted to handle it as a group in the next rehearsal (which was first tech). He then called back saying the producer didn't want it handled as a group to not "stir up animosity/rumors/etc" and to have the man just personal apologize to me. It took him three days to approach me, saying he didn't know what it meant; producer never said a word to me about it, barely talked to me at all unless it was about "business". </p>
                <p>It should be public knowledge that they don't handle issues such as this well. I shared it with the other cast members of color.</p>
                <p>I believe I am fine. I refuse to work there or see shows there, even though I did meet some friendly people during the production. </p>

                <br>
                <p>The non-profit theater I work at hired a new company manager. She is a white woman with dreadlocks. This is just one of many choices I think speaks to how racially tone deaf the organization is.  I am one a few people of color who work on my floor, majority of the top leadership is white and male. </p>
                <p>I'm not even sure, but seeing this woman makes me uncomfortable.  </p>
                <p>I think at the moment i'm posing a lot of questions to myself. I'm wanting to share more about my experience here. Eventually i would like to present evidence and a personal statement to leadership but i'm not ready yet.  </p>

                <br>
                <p>The Book Club Play by Karen Zacarias specifically calls for one of the characters to be played by an African-American and from the looks of the press shots, they had an all-white cast. I called the theatre to ask about it and I got the box office who said they did not know the details of the casting and if permission was granted by the playwright. They said they would pass my contact info on to the director who would get back to me but that never happened. I called twice more and got the voicemail so I left a message but never heard back from anyone.</p>
                <p>I'm okay. This incident took place at a theatre I have no association with. I served as the dramaturg to a production of The Book Club Play which is why I am aware of the casting specifics.  </p>
                <p>The wishes of the playwright should always be respected.</p>

                <br>
                <p>The Knoxville Opera company put on a racist production of Madama Butterfly, an opera that heavily features yellowface. When confronted about it, members of the production company accused local Asians of being racist for complaining about yellowface, and Knoxville Opera has been censoring marginalized voices by delete Facebook comments and reviews.</p>
                <p>Knoxville Opera needs to address it's long history of participating in yellowface and blackface.</p>

                <p>Use of slurs (the n word, spic, beaner, etc.) The play itself was racist and tokenized Latinx people. The Latinx actor was never asked for credentials, resume, audition, even though the more under qualified white counterpart was. Created an uncomfortable unsafe space. Specifically bad was the director Jeannine Grizzard.</p>
                <p>The company should not produce any work that features POCs.</p>
                <p>I was furious and ashamed. I felt very inferior as a result of this experience.</p>

                <p>This company has produced their flagship show portraying Native American characters using white actors in brown makeup for years. They appear at many cattle calls, recruiting many young college students who are desperate for work. They are unapologetic about their “tradition” and have only chosen to retire this racist relic this year after their 50TH ANNIVERSARY. I was asked in a callback in 2015 to read a side from a show titled “the White Savage”, which I believe is the actual name of the show in question. I have also met several people who worked for them who all expressed the company’s lax attitudes regarding racial caricature. </p>
                <p>Workshops on inclusion and anti-racism should be necessary for all existing staff, if not an entire new crop of people to represent this organization. Collaborating with Native American theatre artists and activists and also donating a serious amount of money to local tribes in their Ohio region. </p>

                <p>Production of "Little Foxes" </p>
                <p>5/10/2018</p>
                <br>
                <p>"There is a theatre, one of the only community theatres in the area. In the past 20 years, I've maybe seen 2 or 3 black actors in any of their productions, despite there being a pretty diverse community.  
The plays are chosen by a board of directors. There are no POC on the board.  In 2018, they decided to do a show called ""The Little Foxes"" from 1939. The show is about a family that owns a plantation and are plotting against one another for the inheritance. The N-word is used MANY times in the show. 

At the auditions, they made an announcement that they are going to use the word, as written, and that if anybody has a problem with saying it, they should leave the audition. A few people walked out. I heard later that those people who left were...talked about. I do not remember what was said but I was told it was negative. They explained that the word was being used in context but I don't see why they needed to pick that play in the first place. 

There was one or two African-American characters in the show, I believe.  Everybody auditioning was white. After the show was cast, that were not able to cast one of the roles because they ""didn't have a black"". I heard that they went to the local high school to find a black actor who would play the role. Nobody wanted to do it so they ended up casting a white kid in the role. 

After some criticism, the director said that the actors could say ""nigra"" (which seemed just as bad) instead. Some actors chose to just say the N-word. 
They wonder why they don't have a more diverse group of people auditioning. I don't understand why an all white group of people with a mostly white group of actors would choose to do a show that uses this word, even in ""context"". 

A few years earlier, they had done a show  ""Lend Me A Tenor"" about a backstage production of Othello, where two white actors ""end up"" in blackface. For comedic effect. Okay. There is a framed picture of one of the actors ""in costume"" wearing blackface and it is kept in the greenroom. There are many framed pictures of past productions in the front lobby, usually of the full cast. This framed picture is in the greenroom and it is the only picture back there. It was explained away as ""oh, that's the joke. It's poking fun at racism"". Yeah. That doesn't feel right. "</p>
                <p>I'm not sure. The playhouse is currently closed, due to COVID-19. I think that in the future, they need to pick shows that don't have racist themes. There are thousands of plays to choose from. It's odd that they'd pick these. </p>

                <p>6/2/2020</p>
                <br>
                <p>I had suggested that we as a theatre say something on behalf of the black creatives and employee at our children’s theatre to ensure they matter and are supported during this time.  The board denied that we should acknowledge and/or publicly speak about The Black Lives Matter Movement or anything near the likes of it.  When asked for an explanation I was given a white-excuse of the movement is “too political “ and the only thing the theatre speaks about are theatre-related events. I then suggested to the managing director and the board that we could be more inclusive in our values and mission statement instead of having “everyone” or “all”. Considering the current zeitgeist of the world it is imperative that we acknowledge the different minorities we accept. The theatre rejected my request again , stating that they already include people such as myself by “paying me” and allowing me to work here. The theatre has a total of 4 minorities students( 1 black boy, 2 black girls, and 1 adopted Asian girl), two  Black part-time employees including myself  and one resident choreographer. When mentioning this to the theatre I was faced with hostility and rejection. When the board said they would look over their values I was given a timeline of at least two years. The managing director also said that she had “bigger problems” to face and was hesitant about giving me the boards information so I could talk with them directly. It has come to my knowledge that as a black , openly queer man I do not feel included . I am not on the KCT website either under their employees even though my headshots were taken around the same time as everyone else’s. This theatre has neglected to acknowledge the current zeitgeist of the world and how it makes BIPOC people especially Black people during this time feel. They are stuck in their traditional ways and only want to make a profit off of plays depicting BIPOC stories but not our lives! The theatre even wants me (as a black queer man) to recruit more kids of color , but I am unable to ensure these kids that their voices will be heard and their feelings will be valid amongst this white space.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In order to make their BIPOC kids and employees, parents and organizations feel included they must implement a new detailed  mission statement. They must acknowledge when their voices and support are needed for BIPOC students , employees and organizations that they profit from regardless of their religion, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, disability etc. The theatre must educate themselves on the systemic socioeconomic disadvantages  BIPOC and BIPOC LGBTQ+  individuals endure from the moment they are born. The theatre must LISTEN and RESPECT their BIPOC employees , parents, students and organizations they associate  themselves with. The theatre must be truthful and honest about how , where, when and why the need to continue to implement new rules and ways to insure an inclusive and diverse atmosphere. The theatre must be specific and detailed in their goals to ensure clarity amongst any, every, and all humans that are parts of the theatre be it temporary , semi- permanent or permanent.</p>
                <p>I would like support during this time, however my BIPOC coworkers are fearful of loosing their job. I need allyship during this time and support within a theatre I work hard to help keep. I am hardly eating and have suffered from insomnia since I have received a response from my initial letter. </p>
