                <p>42nd Street Moon is producing HOT MIKADO, which is based on THE MIKADO. Asian American theatre makers in the Bay Area did a great deal of work in protest of Lamplighters Music Theatre's production of THE MIKADO in 2016, which led to widespread change surrounding that show. This year a few actors shared their feelings of discomfort surrounding HOT MIKADO. We don't know the script of HOT MIKADO that well and aren't sure if it's as racist as its predecessor, but it seems questionable. </p>
                <p>If it is as racist as THE MIKADO, it shouldn't be produced. </p>

                <p>Silhouette Productions "Music Man" in Cleveland, Ohio </p>
                <p>9/28/2019</p>
                <br>
                <p>I played Alma Hicks in the musical "Music Man" for Silhouette Productions. I was one of three black people in a cast of about 50, and the only that was a "Pick-a-little" girl. The director asked to run something with the Pick-a-littles and an older man in the cast said "you mean pickaninis?" And walked away laughing, pretending not to hear me ask him not to say that. I emailed the director, music director, and producer about the incident. The director, a younger white man, was very apologetic, admitted he heard it in rehearsal before but didn't know what it meant, and wanted to handle it as a group in the next rehearsal (which was first tech). He then called back saying the producer didn't want it handled as a group to not "stir up animosity/rumors/etc" and to have the man just personal apologize to me. It took him three days to approach me, saying he didn't know what it meant; producer never said a word to me about it, barely talked to me at all unless it was about "business". </p>
                <p>It should be public knowledge that they don't handle issues such as this well. I shared it with the other cast members of color.</p>
                <p>I believe I am fine. I refuse to work there or see shows there, even though I did meet some friendly people during the production. </p>

                <br>
                <p>The non-profit theater I work at hired a new company manager. She is a white woman with dreadlocks. This is just one of many choices I think speaks to how racially tone deaf the organization is.  I am one a few people of color who work on my floor, majority of the top leadership is white and male. </p>
                <p>I'm not even sure, but seeing this woman makes me uncomfortable.  </p>
                <p>I think at the moment i'm posing a lot of questions to myself. I'm wanting to share more about my experience here. Eventually i would like to present evidence and a personal statement to leadership but i'm not ready yet.  </p>

                <br>
                <p>The Book Club Play by Karen Zacarias specifically calls for one of the characters to be played by an African-American and from the looks of the press shots, they had an all-white cast. I called the theatre to ask about it and I got the box office who said they did not know the details of the casting and if permission was granted by the playwright. They said they would pass my contact info on to the director who would get back to me but that never happened. I called twice more and got the voicemail so I left a message but never heard back from anyone.</p>
                <p>I'm okay. This incident took place at a theatre I have no association with. I served as the dramaturg to a production of The Book Club Play which is why I am aware of the casting specifics.  </p>
                <p>The wishes of the playwright should always be respected.</p>

                <br>
                <p>The Knoxville Opera company put on a racist production of Madama Butterfly, an opera that heavily features yellowface. When confronted about it, members of the production company accused local Asians of being racist for complaining about yellowface, and Knoxville Opera has been censoring marginalized voices by delete Facebook comments and reviews.</p>
                <p>Knoxville Opera needs to address it's long history of participating in yellowface and blackface.</p>

                <p>Use of slurs (the n word, spic, beaner, etc.) The play itself was racist and tokenized Latinx people. The Latinx actor was never asked for credentials, resume, audition, even though the more under qualified white counterpart was. Created an uncomfortable unsafe space. Specifically bad was the director Jeannine Grizzard.</p>
                <p>The company should not produce any work that features POCs.</p>
                <p>I was furious and ashamed. I felt very inferior as a result of this experience.</p>

                <p>I'm very disappointed and tired. Four years ago, I went back to my hometown to do a TEDx Talk about yellowface, whitewashing, and Orientalism and this happens in 2020. </p>
