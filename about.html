                I facilitate anti-racist theatre training for theatremakers all over the globe. Anti-racist theatre (A.R.T) is defined as practices and policies that actively acknowledge and interrogate racism generating dynamic anti-racist ideas, values, and policies that counter the oppression of any group of people in any aspect of education or production of theatre.

                <h2>How To Use This Site</h2>
                You may report overt or covert instances that run on the spectrum of, "I know that's racist," to, "I'm not sure..." In the case of "I'm not sure...," trust your gut. It more than likely was, in fact, racism.

                <h2>Why I Started This Website</h2>
                This website is a product of my anti-racist ethos. It’s a tool for releasing the racism and trauma we’ve been taught to hold within our bodies; the result of which, is career burnout and life burnout. Literally, the life expectancy of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color is shortened due to the impact of daily systemic racism. <strong class="accent"> <a href="http://aapf.org/shortened-lifespan"> Learn more at <b>African American Policy Forum.</b></a>

                <i>Our collective silence protects racists giving room for racist ideas and policies to flourish.</i> </strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                <i> Our collective resilience, ingenuity, allyship, and desire for justice fortifies us against hopelessness, fear, and the lie that change is gradual and not possible in our lifetime.</i>

                <h2>What's Next?</h2>
                Once reports start coming in, we will be working to create a scrolling “newsfeed" of your reports. We also aim to add options that allow you to send your report as an audio file. <strong class="accent"> <a href="support.html">Donate </a> </strong> to the web developers to help make sure this can happen.
