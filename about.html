            <p>My name is Nicole Brewer. I facilitate anti-racist theatre training for theatremakers all over the globe.  Anti-racist theatre (A.R.T) is defined as practices and policies that actively acknowledge and interrogate racism generating dynamic anti-racist ideas, values, and policies that counter the oppression of any group of people in any aspect of education or production of theatre.  

            Report Racism in Theatre documents racism, racist ideas, practices and policies that are occuring in all areas that comprise of the theatre industry; including, training institutions, producing organizations, unions, and more. 

            This resource is for our healing.  It’s about sharing our experiences as a means of collective resilience to the systematic norms that require our complicity in our own continued oppression.

            <h2>How To Use This Site</h2>
            <br>
            <p>You may report overt or covert instances of racism, racist ideas, practices, and policies that you or someone you know has experienced in the theatre industry running the spectrum of “I know that’s racist,” to “I'm not sure…” In the case of, "I'm not sure," trust your gut. It more than likely was racism. 

            Feel free to share what you’re comfortable sharing. Any length of report is welcome. 

            Your report can be in any form; poetry, paragraph, short sentence, song, scene, etc. 

            You can use your name or be anonymous.

            <h2>Why I Started This Website</h2>
            <br>
            <p>This website is a product of my anti-racist ethos. It’s a tool for releasing the racism and trauma we’ve been taught to hold within our bodies; the result of which, is career burnout and life burnout. Literally the life expectancy of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color are shortened due to the impact of daily systemic racism. Learn more at African American Policy Forum.

            Our collective silence protects racists giving room for racist ideas and policies to flourish.  

            Our collective resilience, ingenuity, allyship, and desire for justice fortifies us against hopelessness, fear, and the lie that change is gradual and not possible in our lifetime.
